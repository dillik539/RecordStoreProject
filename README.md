This program manages the record album obtained from consignors - record consignor's name, phone numbers, artist's name, title, and     marked price in a database. It also stores, date sold, payment info to consignor and more..
The GUI looks simple, but contains many cool features. It has five JLists that basically displays inventory records, sold item records, payment info, bargain list records (if any), and donated item records (if any).
inventory records can be moved to bargain list only after 30 days, and bargain list records can be moved to donated item only after a year.
It displays the number of days in inventory in different JLabel.
A record can only be deleted if 'Yes' is selected from the 'Return To Consignor?' combox box.
A database must exists before running the program.
To create a database in MYSQL, use this syntax: create database databasename;
